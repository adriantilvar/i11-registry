# i11 Registry

A personal collection of components, utilities, configurations, and guides for building web applications quickly without unnecessary dependencies.

Inspired by shadcn/ui, but streamlined and expanded beyond UI to include functionality, helpers, configurations, and guides. Opinionated, practical, and ready to use.

## What's Inside

### Components
Clean, dependency-light UI components you can drop directly into your project.

### Functions
Drop-in utility functions for common tasksâ€”strings, arrays, runtime safety, and security. No need to install tiny npm packages when you can just copy the code you need.

### Files
Battle-tested configuration files for Biome, Tailwind, VSCode, and your terminal. Stop digging through old repos to find that config that worked perfectly.

### Types
TypeScript utilities for common type transformations and patterns. Skip the hassle of reinventing generics or frantically searching through blogs.

### Guides
Step-by-step instructions for setting up features like internationalization and type-safe environment variables. For when you figured something out once and don't want to make it painful again.

### Cool Tricks
Fun gimmicks you can use in your app for the joy of it.

## Philosophy

- **Own your code**: Copy what you need instead of installing dependencies
- **Reduce bloat**: Avoid transitive dependencies and unnecessary supply chain risks
- **Move fast**: Pre-configured, tested, and ready to drop into your projects
- **Stay practical**: Opinionated choices based on real-world use
