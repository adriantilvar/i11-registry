import { Container, Brackets } from 'lucide-react';

Generics so long and complex you need a PhD to decipher them. Back and forth with ChatGPT trying to force some constraints on an argument. Frantically searching through Matt Pocock's blog for that neat utility type. Sound familiar? Skip the hassle with these common type transformations and patterns, so you can focus on *UX*, not just DXâ„¢:

<Cards>
  <Card 
    icon={<Container />}
    title="Base Helpers" 
    href="/docs/types/base" 
  />

  <Card 
    icon={<Brackets />}
    title="Array Helpers" 
    href="/docs/types/array" 
  />
</Cards>
