## Prettify

  Takes an object type and makes the hover overlay more readable.

  ```ts
  type Prettify<T> = {
    [K in keyof T]: T[K];
  } & {};
  ```

## Maybe

  Returns a union of the type and a potentially missing value, such as `undefined` or `null`. 

  ```ts
  type Maybe<T> = NoInfer<T | undefined | null>;
  ```

  *Note: `NoInfer` is used to provide a more readable hover overlay.*

## AnyFn

  Represents a function that can take any number and type of arguments and return any. Sometimes TypeScript forces you to use it in generics.
  
  ```ts
  type AnyFn = (...args: any[]) => any;
  ```
