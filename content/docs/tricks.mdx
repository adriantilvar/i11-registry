## Emoji Favicon

  Use an emoji as your website's favicon. Just replace the emoji with your favorite one and drop this in the root layout:

  ```html
  <head>
    <link
      rel="icon"
      href="data:image/svg+xml,<svg xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22 viewBox=%220 0 100 100%22><text y=%22.9em%22 font-size=%2290%22>ðŸ“¦</text></svg>"
    />
    ...
  </head>
  ```
